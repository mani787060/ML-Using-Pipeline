## Using Pipeline in Machine Learning

-> This project demonstrates how to build and use **Pipelines** in scikit-learn to simplify and automate the ML workflow.  
-> By combining preprocessing steps and models into a single pipeline, we make the process cleaner, more efficient, and less error-prone.


# Topics Covered:-
-> Creating a Pipeline  
-> Combining preprocessing and modeling steps  
-> Ensuring consistent data transformation  
-> Simplifying training and prediction workflows  

# Libraries Used:-
-> pandas  
-> numpy  
-> scikit-learn  

# Key Takeaway:-
-> Pipelines help "avoid data leakage", make "experiments reproducible", and ensure a smooth ML workflow â€” from preprocessing to prediction.
